# Chris Bailey

Hi there, I'm Chris - long time software developer, CTO, company co-founder, and tech enthusiast. I also love espresso, mountain biking, skiing, trail running, climbing, books, and my family. I'm based in [Bend, OR](https://goo.gl/maps/cKq48Jfrft9txYwv8).

I'm currently co-founder and CTO at [NatureQuant](https://www.naturequant.com), where we're delivering technology to assess and promote nature exposure. Nature provides profound mental and physical health benefits. Through innovative tech and data science, we provide tools to leverage nature's impact.
